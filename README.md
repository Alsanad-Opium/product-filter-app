# Product Filter Application

This project is a web-based application that allows users to filter and search products by name and category. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app provides an intuitive interface for browsing products with dynamic filtering capabilities.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for products by entering keywords in the search bar.
- **Category Filtering**: Filter products by selecting specific categories.
- **Dynamic Display**: Products dynamically update based on user input and category selection.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling for the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for filtering and dynamic updates.

## How It Works

1. **Search Bar**: Users can type product names, and the app will filter and display matching products in real time.
2. **Category Buttons**: Clicking on a category button filters products belonging to that category.
3. **Combination of Filters**: Both search input and category filters work together to refine the product list.
